<h1>Linux From Scratch</h1>

<p>This repository contains scripts and files for building a custom Linux distribution using the <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">Linux From Scratch (LFS)</a> methodology. The scripts provided automate various steps of the LFS build process, making it easier to reproduce and customize the Linux distribution.</p>

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>

<p>The repository has the following structure:</p>

<pre>
├── change_owner.sh

├── lfs-temp-tools-11.3.tar.xz
├── make_limited_dir.sh
├── mount_partitions.sh
├── mount_virtual_kernel_fs.sh
├── progress.log
├── README.md (this file)
├── start_up.sh
├── transfer.sh
├── umount_partitions.sh
└── wget-list-sysv
</pre>

<p>Here's a brief description of each file:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>change_owner.sh</code>: A script to change ownership of directories and files in the LFS build environment.</li>
  <li><code>enter_chroot.sh</code>: A script to enter the chroot environment, allowing you to work inside the temporary LFS system.</li>
  <li><code>lfs-temp-tools-11.3.tar.xz</code>: A compressed tarball containing essential tools and packages for the LFS build process.</li>
  <li><code>make_limited_dir.sh</code>: A script to create a directory with limited permissions for security purposes.</li>
  <li><code>mount_partitions.sh</code>: A script to mount the necessary partitions before entering the chroot environment.</li>
  <li><code>mount_virtual_kernel_fs.sh</code>: A script to mount the virtual kernel file systems required by the LFS build process.</li>
  <li><code>progress.log</code>: A log file that tracks the progress of the LFS build process.</li>
  <li><code>README.md</code> (this file): An overview of the repository and its contents.</li>
  <li><code>start_up.sh</code>: A script to set up the initial environment before starting the LFS build process.</li>
  <li><code>transfer.sh</code>: A script to transfer essential files and scripts into the temporary LFS system.</li>
  <li><code>umount_partitions.sh</code>: A script to unmount the mounted partitions after exiting the chroot environment.</li>
  <li><code>wget-list-sysv</code>: A text file containing the list of URLs for downloading the necessary packages for the LFS build process.</li>
</ul>
